Dr. Marc Carriquí is a fundamental researcher in plant ecophysiology, with a particular interest on the structure and function of plants from a perspective of biodiversity and evolution. His research is focused on (1) how CO2 diffuses inside photosynthetic organs, (2) how plants transport and use water, and (3) which are the physiological thresholds for both CO2 and water movement inside plants under environmental stress. His scientific contributions have allowed a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of photosynthesis and hydraulics of the main land plant groups, from mosses and ferns to gymnosperms and angiosperms. Some of his major findings include the discovery of a trend towards photosynthesis optimization along land plant phylogeny, the identification of mesophyll cell walls as a key trait determining the general trade-off between photosynthesis and stress tolerance, or the demonstration of an integrated and efficient vascular function in a moss, a “non-vascular” plant clade, which challenges the dogma linking plant success to vascular evolution, among others. Altogether, the results that he is obtaining are being of help to plant biotechnologists and evolutionary ecologists, as they suggest new targets for the improvement of photosynthetic capacity (i.e. crop yield) and allow to better predict how plants are likely to respond to climate change.
