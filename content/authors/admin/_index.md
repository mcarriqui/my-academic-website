Dr. Marc Carriquí is a fundamental researcher in plant ecophysiology, with a particular interest on the structure and function of plants from a perspective of biodiversity and evolution. His research is focused on (1) how CO2 diffuses inside photosynthetic organs, (2) how plants transport and use water, and (3) which are the physiological thresholds for both CO2 and water movement inside plants under environmental stress.
