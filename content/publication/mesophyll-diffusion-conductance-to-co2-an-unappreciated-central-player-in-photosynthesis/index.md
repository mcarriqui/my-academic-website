abstract: >-
  Mesophyll diffusion conductance to CO2 is a key photosynthetic trait that has
  been studied intensively in the past years. The intention of the present
  review is to update knowledge of gm, and highlight the important unknown and
  controversial aspects that require future work. The photosynthetic limitation
  imposed by mesophyll conductance is large, and under certain conditions can be
  the most significant photosynthetic limitation. New evidence shows that
  anatomical traits, such as cell wall thickness and chloroplast distribution
  are amongst the stronger determinants of mesophyll conductance, although rapid
  variations in response to environmental changes might be regulated by other
  factors such as aquaporin conductance.


  Gaps in knowledge that should be research priorities for the near future include: how different is mesophyll conductance among phylogenetically distant groups and how has it evolved? Can mesophyll conductance be uncoupled from regulation of the water path? What are the main drivers of mesophyll conductance? The need for mechanistic and phenomenological models of mesophyll conductance and its incorporation in process-based photosynthesis models is also highlighted.
