abstract: "Mesophyll diffusion conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> is a key photosynthetic trait
  that has been studied intensively in the past years. The intention of the
  present review is to update knowledge of g<sub>m</sub>, and highlight the important
  unknown and controversial aspects that require future work. The photosynthetic
  limitation imposed by mesophyll conductance is large, and under certain
  conditions can be the most significant photosynthetic limitation. New evidence
  shows that anatomical traits, such as cell wall thickness and chloroplast
  distribution are amongst the stronger determinants of mesophyll conductance,
  although rapid variations in response to environmental changes might be
  regulated by othe factors such as aquaporin conductance. Gaps in knowledge
  that should be research priorities for the near future include: how different
  is mesophyll conductance among phylogenetically distant groups and how has it
  evolved? Can mesophyll conductance be uncoupled from regulation of the water
  path? What are the main drivers of mesophyll conductance? The need for
  mechanistic and phenomenological models of mesophyll conductance and its
  incorporation in process-based photosynthesis models is also highlighted."
